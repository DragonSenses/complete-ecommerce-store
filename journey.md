# Start of a journey

This will document all the progress and work in creating this project.

# The Design and Setup

This project consists of two parts: 1) E-commerce store front web application & 2) The Admin Dashboard.

These will also include the API Calls.

The technologies I plan to use:

- TypeScript

Front-End
- Next.js 13's App Router
- Tailwind CSS
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), Radix UI

Database
- MySQL
- PlanetScale
- Prisma (ORM)

## Discussion on why each tech was used

- Next.js 13 App Router is my new favorite way to create front-end application with client-side routing.
- Tailwind CSS is just a preference, I prefer how the ease of styling and responsive design. Another favorite.

### [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

Looking at the documentation [shadcn/ui docs intro](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs), it is **NOT** a component library.

Examples of a component library are:

- [Material UI Kit](https://mui.com/material-ui/)
- [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/)

These are primary npm packages, so you cannot individually install e.g., a button.

On the other hand, what `shadcn/ui` offers instead is that it you can pick out individual components you need and copy and paste it into your project. This offers more control, configuration, and flexibility.

**We can build our own component system and not be dependent on any 3rd party npm library which needs to be updated and maintained.**

#### How can I use `shadcn/ui`?

Let's take a look at the [`Button` element](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/button).

Under the **Installation** tab:

- We can either use **Command Line Interface (CLI)** to install it
  
  ```sh
  npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
  ```

- Or we can click on **Manual** and hit *Expand* to see the exact code to add it into our project.

This will also allow us to modify anything from the `size` of the component or the `variants` names.

#### Install and configure **Next.js** project with `shadcn/ui`

[Install Next.js with `shadcn/ui`](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next).

Let's install `shadcn/ui` through the official `create-next-app`.

I want to use typescipt, tailwind, and eslint. I will call this project `ecommerce-admin`.

So in the terminal, here is the command we go with:

```sh
npx create-next-app@latest ecommerce-admin --typescript --tailwind --eslint
```

Here is the prompt in the terminal, you can use arrow keys to choose `Yes` or `No` and press `[Enter]` to select the prompt:

```sh
npx create-next-app@latest ecommerce-admin --typescript --tailwind --eslint
Need to install the following packages:
  create-next-app@13.4.13
Ok to proceed? (y) y
√ Would you like to use `src/` directory? ... [No] / Yes
√ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) ... No / [Yes]
√ Would you like to customize the default import alias? ... [No] / Yes
Creating a new Next.js app in C:\Users\...\complete-ecommerce-store\ecommerce-admin.
```

Make sure to select Yes to `App Router` which heavily relies on server components. The alternative is `Pages Router`, the old way.

For customizing `import alias`, I select No to default it to the `@` sign. We'll come back to this when we do imports in the code.

The packages have been installed and the app is ready.

Let's change directory into the `/ecommerce-admin`, then proceed with step 2 of the installation.

```sh
cd .\ecommerce-admin\
```

Then initialize `shadcn-ui` to setup project:

```sh
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

Here are the prompts, I just pressed Enter to all the default options:

```sh
npx shadcn-ui@latest init                                                                                                          
Need to install the following packages:
  shadcn-ui@0.3.0
Ok to proceed? (y) y
√ Would you like to use TypeScript (recommended)? ... no / [yes]
√ Which style would you like to use? » [Default]
√ Which color would you like to use as base color? » [Slate]
√ Where is your global CSS file? ... [app/globals.css]
√ Would you like to use CSS variables for colors? ... no / [yes]
√ Where is your tailwind.config.js located? ... [tailwind.config.js]
√ Configure the import alias for components: ... [@/components]
√ Configure the import alias for utils: ... [@/lib/utils]
√ Are you using React Server Components? ... no / [yes]
√ Write configuration to components.json. Proceed? ... [yes]
```

## Run the project

Finally we can run the project with the command `npm run dev`. In the terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Now the project should be visible at this URL: `http://localhost:3000`, so open this up in the browser.

And to shut-down the application we can press `[Ctrl + C]` in the terminal. Since we are making big changes, its a good idea to do so now as this may interfere with hot reloading or Next.js feature called *Fast Refresh*.

- Hot reloading is a feature that allows you to see the changes you make to your code in real-time without having to refresh the page. In Next.js, this feature is called Fast Refresh and it's enabled by default in all Next.js applications on 9.4 or newer. With Fast Refresh enabled, most edits should be visible within a second, without losing component state.

## Cleaning Up the Project

Now in Visual Studio Code, let's open up `/app/page.tsx` and go ahead and remove all the boilerplate code within the `Home` component. Also remove the import for `Image`.`

So all we are left with is something like this:

```js
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>Admin Dashboard</div>
  )
}
```

Let's also change the `MetaData` in `layout.tsx`, we can just modify the `title` and `description`.

```ts
import './globals.css'
import type { Metadata } from 'next'
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google'

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Admin Dashboard',
  description: 'Admin Dashboard for e-commerce store',
}

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

## Add height configuration in `globals.css`

The `globals.css` file contains all the styling for our app. All the code within has been modified by `shadcn-ui`. The only addition we want to add is adding a height configuration to nearly all our content.

Right below the `@tailwind` directives, add this:

```css
html,
body,
:root {
  height: 100%;
}
```

-# Start of a journey

This will document all the progress and work in creating this project.

# The Design and Setup

This project consists of two parts: 1) E-commerce store front web application & 2) The Admin Dashboard.

These will also include the API Calls.

The technologies I plan to use:

- Next.js 13's App Router
- Tailwind CSS
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), Radix UI

Database
- MySQL
- PlanetScale
- Prisma (ORM)

## Discussion on why each tech was used

- Next.js 13 App Router is my new favorite way to create front-end application with client-side routing.
- Tailwind CSS is just a preference, I prefer how the ease of styling and responsive design. Another favorite.

### [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

Looking at the documentation [shadcn/ui docs intro](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs), it is **NOT** a component library.

Examples of a component library are:

- [Material UI Kit](https://mui.com/material-ui/)
- [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/)

These are primary npm packages, so you cannot individually install e.g., a button.

On the other hand, what `shadcn/ui` offers instead is that it you can pick out individual components you need and copy and paste it into your project. This offers more control, configuration, and flexibility.

#### How can I use `shadcn/ui`?
